It's an adblock for android using the powerful framework Xposed. It allows user to simply tap something on the screen to block it.
Notice that it do NOT block a thing in WebViews and in-game interfaces such as GLSurfaceViews.
There're many adblocks that blocks webpage advertisments already and you can use 'em.
